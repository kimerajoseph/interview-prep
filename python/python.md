## BINARY TREES
A binary tree is a data structure in which every node or vertex has at most two children. In Python, a binary tree can be represented in different ways with different data structures(dictionary, list) and class representations for a node.

## SEARCH ALGORITHIMS
Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored. Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are generally classified into two categories:

## Sequential Search: 
In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. For example: Linear Search

## Interval Search: 
These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. For Example: Binary Search.

## Linear Search
Defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set. It is the easiest searching algorithm

## Binary Search
Is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(Log n).
